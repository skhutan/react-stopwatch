# Stopwatch Implementation Exercise

## Objective

Build a stopwatch application using React and TypeScript that accurately updates the time without any data loss.

## Requirements
- User should be able to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- The time should update in a manner that minimizes calculation delays and ensures accurate time tracking.
- The displayed time should be formatted as HH:MM:SS.
- The stopwatch must not lose time over prolonged use, meaning the calculation of elapsed time should be precise.
- Write TypeScript types wherever applicable.

### Example Output

```
Stopwatch
00:00:00
[Start] [Stop] [Reset]
```

### Evaluation Criteria
  - Correctness: The stopwatch should function as expected without losing time.
  - Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-structured, and commented.
  - TypeScript Usage: Proper use of TypeScript for type safety.

### Good luck, and happy coding!
